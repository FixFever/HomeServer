# Configurations for hardware-accelerated transcoding

# If using Unraid or another platform that doesn't allow multiple Compose files,
# you can inline the config for a backend by copying its contents
# into the immich-microservices service in the docker-compose.yml file.

# See https://immich.app/docs/features/hardware-transcoding for more info on using hardware transcoding.
